Spectrum is an XMPP transport/gateway. It allows XMPP users to communicate with
their friends who are using one of the supported networks. It supports a wide
range of different networks such as ICQ, XMPP (Jabber, GTalk), AIM, MSN,
Facebook, Twitter, Gadu-Gadu, IRC and SIMPLE. Spectrum is written in C++
and uses the Swiften XMPP library and libpurple for “legacy networks”.
Spectrum is open source and released under the GNU GPL.
